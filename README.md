# GP_Pre-reg
Code repository for pre-registered methodological investigation of Gaussian process models as potential tools for imputing corrupted heart rate data

The code contained in this repository will be used to conduct a methodological investigation of the use of Gaussian process models to "predict" missing values in heart rate signal due to signal noise and/or artifact. Any and all are welcome to use the information contained within this repository for their own work.
